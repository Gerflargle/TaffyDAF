# TaffyDAF
For Forge 1.14.x

What does TaffyDAF do?
TaffyDAF adds to the 'Join Multiplayer' showing the server's Day, current time, and weather.
For example: Hate joining the world when its night and raining? Now you can know ahead of time and wait a few minutes before you join. 

Where does this need to be(Server/Client)?
This needs to be setup on the Server. Client side is not needed, however, a client may have the mod in the folder(it should do nothing).

Config Options:
Set which Dim ID to target(Default is the Overworld). If set differently, set it to a dim that is loaded.

Can I use this in a pack?
Have at it.
